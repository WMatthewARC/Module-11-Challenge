## For this challenge I made a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

Working off the starting files I was able to make 7 more pages, 4 detailing the graphs and others being functional landing page, comparisons page and a page to show my data set. 

Started with making the navigation bar and getting the classes from the CSS file in place for background text and format of the images and text.
